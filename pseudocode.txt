Create a MODULE named Scrabble to encapsulate all

There will be a CLASS called Scoring.

  and a CLASS METHOD self.score(word)
    input: letter or word
    output: corresponding value or score of word.

    There should be a DATA Structure with letters and their corresponding values.
    Hash - key is letter, value is score?

    When the method is called, it takes an INPUT of a word as a string.

    Then the method should ITERATE through the Data Structure and return the cumulative value or score of the word.

    IF the word INPUT is 7 letters, they get a 50 point bonus.

  and another CLASS METHOD of self.highest_score_from(array_of_words)
    input: array of words
    output: returns the array with the highest score.

    IF there is a tie.
      Return the letter with the shortest length or number of tiles used.
      UNLESS one of the words is 7 letters.
        Then that word wins.
    IF there are multiple words with the same length and score, pick the FIRST in the array.
